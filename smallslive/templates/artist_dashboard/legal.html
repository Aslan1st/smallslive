                        <li><a href="#section-3">Every show in the Archive will have a designated Leader (all of the members of the group may be designated as Leader) otherwise they will be designated as Sidemusician. </a></li>

                        <li><a href="#section-7">All content in the Archive will be stream-only.  Leaders may choose to license individual tracks from a performance to SmallsLIVE for download by providing the title, composer and publishing information for the track.  These individual tracks will be sold for download, exclusively from the SmallsLIVE website, as “SmallsLIVE TRACKS”.  In the case of download sales, the revenue goes directly to the Artist selling the track, not the revenue pool from the subscriptions. </a></li>

                                                <p>All Subscription Fees collected from Subscribers for access to stream (but not download) the Archive shall be shared on a 50-50 basis between SmallsLIVE, on the one hand, and the Musicians (whether Leader or Side Musicians), on the other hand, after the deduction of operational Expenses (as defined below).  All fees will be placed in a Revenue Pool.</p>
                                                <p>The Musicians’ share of the Revenue Pool will be determined by the number of minutes that the Recording of each Date is streamed within a pay period (either bi-annually or quarterly, to be determined by SmallsLIVE). Each Musician who plays on any Date, whether as a Leader or as a Side Musician, will be credited the number of minutes that Subscribers listen to the Date(s).  Musicians must be “tagged” on the date to be credited with the Minutes.  It is the responsibility of the Leader to tag all the Side Musicians on a date and the Side Musicians’ responsibility to see that he or she does so.</p>
                                                <p>The formula for determining a Musician’s share of the Revenue Pool is:</p>
                                                <p class="formula">Total Individual Musicians Minutes divided by the Total Archive usage minutes.</p>

                                                <p class="example">Peter gets 350 minutes listened to for all of his dates in the Archive as Leader or Side Musician</p>
                                                <p class="example">Stacy gets 5000 minutes listened to for all of his dates in the Archive as Leader or Side Musician</p>
                                                <p class="example">Grant gets 700 minutes listened to for all of his dates in the Archive as Leader or Side Musician</p>
                                                <p class="example">Tuomo gets 950 minutes listened to for all of his dates in the Archive as Leader or Side Musician</p>

                                                <p>Adding all these minutes together yields the Total Archive Usage, which in this example equals 8230 minutes.</p>
                                                <p>To calculate the pay percentage attributable to each Musician (“Pay Percentage”), you must divide the individual minutes by the total usage.</p>

                                                <p>Each Musician is paid an amount equal to the total amount collected from Subscription Fees (Revenue Pool) multiplied by his or her Pay Percentage.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><a class="page-scroll" href="#section-1">The SmallsLIVE Archive is the entire collection of audio and videos recordings documenting every show at Smalls Jazz Club since September of 2007.</a></li>
                <li><a class="page-scroll" href="#section-2">SmallsLIVE will offer this Archive to the public for streaming from our website for a subscription fee.  These fees will be pooled and distributed to every Artist in the Archive based on the individual usage of each recording.</a></li>
                <li><a class="page-scroll" href="#section-3">Every show in the Archive will have a designated Leader (all of the members of the group may be designated as Leader) otherwise they will be designated as Sidemusician.</a></li>
                <li><a class="page-scroll" href="#section-4">Ownership of the recording will be 100% the property of the Leader(s) including 100% of the publishing and copyrights.  The Leader(s) may do anything they like with the recordings, including selling it to a third-party.</a></li>
                <li><a class="page-scroll" href="#section-5">The Leader will have the right to decide which dates in the Archive are made public or private.  The Leader may also decide to edit the dates to their satisfaction.</a></li>
                <li><a class="page-scroll" href="#section-5">All musicians “tagged” on the date will be credited with “minutes listened to” as Subscribers use the Archive.  Leaders and Sidemusicians will be equally credited.  Pay out from the revenue collected from subscriptions will be distributed based on the Artist’s percentage of usage.</a></li>
                <li><a class="page-scroll" href="#section-7">All content in the Archive will be stream-only.  Leaders may choose to license individual tracks from a performance to SmallsLIVE for download by providing the title, composer and publishing information for the track.  These individual tracks will be sold for download, exclusively from the SmallsLIVE website, as “SmallsLIVE TRACKS”.  In the case of download sales, the revenue goes directly to the Artist selling the track, not the revenue pool from the subscriptions.</a></li>
                <li><a class="page-scroll" href="#section-5">Every Artist in the SmallsLIVE Archive will have a personal account (accessible by password) in order to update their own information (ie. photos, bios, payment information) and to access any recordings that they are involved with.  Leaders of a date may tag Sidemusicans or designate other Leaders.</a></li>
                <li><a class="page-scroll" href="#section-9">SmallsLIVE can only use these recordings in the context of the SmallsLIVE website and cannot exploit them for use with any other third-party site without the express and written agreement of the Artist.</a></li>
