        The <span class="smalls-color">SmallsLIVE</span> Catalog is a collection
        of individually produced, HD recordings from
        <span class="smalls-color">SmallsLIVE</span> artists. Supporting
        <span class="smalls-color">SmallsLIVE</span> members can access these
        recordings by “sponsoring” the artist’s projects. These tax-deductible
        donations are directly paid to the musicians involved and are for the
        purpose of supporting the livelihood of the artists and to encourage
        their continued work. Sponsorships can be of any size and directed in
        anyway chosen by the Supporting Member. Supporting Members have a
        “library” from which the albums they sponsor can be listened to and
        downloaded as they wish. Unlike a traditional record company our goal is
        not to sell this music but to inspire fans to support their favorite
        Jazz artists by becoming their direct patrons.
