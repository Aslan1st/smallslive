              Education is a key component to the mission of the <span class="smalls-color">SmallsLIVE Foundation</span>.
              Our audio/video archive is a unique resource in the history of jazz, documenting the work of nearly 4000 musicians over twelve consecutive years.
              There are currently more than 15,000 shows from both <span class="smalls-color">Smalls</span> and <span class="mezzrow-color">Mezzrow</span>.
              The archive adds 35 new shows every week.

              The <span class="smalls-color">SmallsLIVE class</span> is an important part of the rethinking of musicology at the School of Jazz & Contemporary Music,
              where students develop their skills in critical thinking, research, and placing art in an historical and social context
              through the lens of living musical cultures.</i><span class="big-quote closing">”</span>

              has given <span class="smalls-color">SmallsLIVE</span> the unique opportunity to create and teach a course with the
              <span class="smalls-color">SmallsLIVE archive</span> as the centerpiece.

              In 2018, “SmallsLIVE: Profiles From The Contemporary Jazz Scene” was premiered at The New School and is now in its second year. 
              Students use the archive to research <span class="smalls-color">SmallsLIVE artists</span> and gain insights into their music and process.
              Student led research groups use the archive to create in-depth profiles of <span class="smalls-color">SmallsLIVE artists</span> through archive transcriptions,
              concert reviews, and interviews. 
              The course also helps familiarize students with various SmallsLIVE artists,
              the history of <span class="smalls-color">Smalls</span> and <span class="mezzrow-color">Mezzrow</span>, and the current scene at both clubs.
              In many cases, the artists themselves are brought to class to speak directly with the students and engage in dialogue.
              <span class="smalls-color">The SmallsLIVE Foundation</span> subsidizes the expense of creating and operating this class.

              have been home to some of the most influential musicians in contemporary jazz music.
              <span class="smalls-color">The SmallsLIVE archive</span> is a one-of-a-kind resource for the academic study of these musicians.
              Our course at the New School presents original research on <span class="smalls-color">SmallsLIVE musicians</span> and engages students in research of their own.
              By using the archive as a tool for academic inquiry, students are given unique insights into the current
              New York jazz scene and the individual artists who have shaped it.
