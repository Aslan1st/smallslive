        In September of 2007 Spike Wilner made the commitment to document every show at Smalls (and in 2014 with Mezzrow) in
        order to preserve what he felt was works of historic importance. Smalls Jazz Club was one of the very first clubs to
        stream shows live from their website. Smalls has developed a true international following thanks to the transmission
        of the shows nightly at no cost. The SmallsLIVE Audio/Video Archive is the collection of all the work done at Smalls
        and Mezzrow to date, over 17,000 recordings and more than 3000 artists.
