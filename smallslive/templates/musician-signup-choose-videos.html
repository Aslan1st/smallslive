Based on your choices above, (2) more recordings will be added into the archive as they now have 100% artist approval  Your peers on these just-released recordings will receive a courtesy email notifying them about these additions to the archive.

    <small class="text-muted text-sm">* Because you do not own the entire video recording (aka the "Master"), you cannot decide alone which videos go live. For each video, you and the side musicians each own a portion of the copyright in the Master recording and so all musicians on each video must agree for a video to go live on the website. By default, your side musicians are "opted in" to your videos and only have 7 days to opt out before the video goes live.</small>
