    <h1>Dev notes</h1>
    <Ul> 
      <li><code>1</code> note pseudo code in comments</li> 
      <li><code>2</code> username would only exist for subscribers.</li>
      <li><code>3</code> if there is an artist photo uploaded but no user photo, display that here. Else, show user profile image.</li>
      <li><code>4</code> all edit links on this page open a dialog to change the requested field using a unique form. Each parameter (row above) will need a unique form and flash/feedback message that can appear in the dialog or in the master div.alert. If you use the ajax dialog to serve alert, be sure the page "below" the dialog is refreshed with the latest content once dialog is closed. See #<code>5</code> for UI requirements for forms</li>
      <li><code>5</code> Forms + Flash messages for each row:
        <ul>
          <li>Photo: do not overwrite the old photo initially: show upload progress, and then replace the old thumb with the new thumb. This should require a "Save" button to commit the change (A cancel link will also be provided + an upload button to try again). I would close dialog and refresh page for this.</li>
          <li>Email: just show an email field. The response should be flash text using div.alert-info "In order for SmallsLIVE to use this new email address, please click the link in the email we just sent you (verifying you own that email account)."</li>
          <li>Password: just show one field (dont require a retype); its easy enough to change the password if its not right. Flash mesg: "Your password was updated successfully.</li>
          <li>Phone: same as password; replace "password" with "phone" in the flash message. Use 1 input field; talk to brian if we need to handle international number entry. </li>
          <li>address: use text inputs for all fields; do not use dropdown for state (use .selectize). talk to brian if we're handling international addresses.</li>
        </ul>
       <li><code>6</code> This email address hasn't been click-verified; this could only happen for a registered user who changes their email after signing up.</li> 
    </Ul>
