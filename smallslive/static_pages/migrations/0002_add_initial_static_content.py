    <p>Smalls Jazz Club was created in 1994 by the enigmatic Mitchell Borden. Borden, a former Navy submariner,
      registered nurse, philosopher & jazz violinist, founded the club with an initiative to create an environment
      that was conducive to Jazz Music and its culture. Borden, who booked and managed the club, approached
      business from a stance of generosity rather than profit. </p>

    <h2>A Club born</h2>

    <p>The original Smalls was a raw basement space and had no liquor license. For just $10, patrons could bring
      their own beer and come to the club at any time, day or night. They could stay as long as they liked and
      often left just as day began to break. Bordenâ€™s concern was only with the music and the musicians who
      created it. Under his generous care, a culture of vibrant and newly energized young musicians claimed Smalls
      as their home base and began to develop their individuality in the music. This included such musicians
      as:</p>

    <p>Howard Alden, J.D. Allen, William Ash, Ehud Asherie, Omer Avital, David Berkman, Peter Bernstein, Brian
      Blade, Seamus Blake, Dwayne Burno, Chris Byars, Shard Cassity, Dwayne Clemons, Jay Collins, Marion Cowings,
